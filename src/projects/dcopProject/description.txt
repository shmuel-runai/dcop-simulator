DCOP Testing Framework
======================

This project provides a framework for testing Distributed Constraint Optimization 
Problem (DCOP) algorithms on different network topologies.

DCOP Problem Definition
-----------------------
A DCOP consists of:
- N agents, each numbered 1 to N
- Each agent selects a value X from domain [0, M-1]
- Some agents are connected to each other (constraint graph)
- Each connected pair has a cost matrix (M x M) defining costs for value combinations
- Total system cost = sum of costs for all connected agent pairs
- Goal: Minimize total system cost through distributed algorithm

Current Implementation
----------------------
The framework currently includes a simple random algorithm where each agent 
randomly selects a value from its domain. This serves as a baseline for 
comparing more sophisticated DCOP algorithms.

Network Topologies
------------------
Currently supports:
- Random Network: Agents are connected with probability = networkDensity

Running in GUI Mode
-------------------
1. Start the simulator:
   ./sinalgo -project dcopProject

2. Click the "Run DCOP Test" button in the GUI

3. The test will:
   - Run multiple iterations (default: 10)
   - Generate a new random problem for each iteration
   - Execute the algorithm with timeout (default: 30 seconds)
   - Display results and save to CSV file

Configuration
-------------
Edit Config.xml to modify test parameters:
- numIterations: Number of test runs (default: 10)
- timeoutSeconds: Max time per iteration (default: 30)
- numAgents: Number of agents (default: 10)
- domainSize: Domain size M (default: 5)
- minCost/maxCost: Cost range (default: 0-100)
- networkDensity: Connection probability (default: 0.3)
- problemSeed: Initial seed for problem generation (default: 1000)
- algorithmSeed: Initial seed for algorithm randomness (default: 2000)

Note: Seeds are incremented by 1 for each iteration to ensure different problems.

Running in Batch Mode
----------------------
For automated testing without GUI:
   ./sinalgo -project dcopProject -batch

Results are printed to console and saved to logs/dcop_results_[timestamp].csv

Results Format
--------------
CSV output includes:
- Iteration number
- Runtime in milliseconds
- Total cost achieved
- Agent value assignments

Console output includes:
- Per-iteration results
- Average cost across all iterations
- Average runtime

Extending the Framework
-----------------------
To implement a new DCOP algorithm:
1. Modify DCOPAgent.startAlgorithm() to implement your algorithm
2. Use handleMessages() to process neighbor messages
3. Use ValueMessage to communicate with neighbors
4. The DCOPProblem object provides access to neighbors and cost functions

The shared code in src/common/dcop/ can be reused across multiple algorithm 
implementations, making it easy to compare different approaches.
