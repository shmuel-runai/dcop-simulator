MPC Test Suite

This Sinalgo project demonstrates the Distributed Protocol Framework for Multi-Party Computation (MPC).

Features:
- Full mesh network of 10 nodes
- Automated testing of 100 iterations
- Each iteration tests:
  1. Share distribution for two random secrets (a and b)
  2. Secure addition (a + b = res-c) using local MPC computation
  3. Secret reconstruction to verify correctness
  4. Protocol cleanup between iterations

The first node (ID=1) acts as the test coordinator and orchestrates all tests.
All nodes participate in the distributed protocols.

Protocols used:
- Share Distribution: Distribute a secret value to all nodes
- Secure Add MPC: Locally compute shares for sum of two secrets
- Reconstruct Secret: Collect shares and reconstruct the secret value

Implementation files:
- MPCTestNode.java: Custom node with protocol manager integration
- FullMesh.java: Connectivity model for complete graph
- Config.xml: Sinalgo framework configuration
